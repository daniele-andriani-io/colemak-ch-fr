# Colemak layout for the Kimiko Rev.1 from Keycapss

For the last couple of weeks I've been working on a layout to work with this nice split keyboard. I've wanted to try out the Colemak layout but was in need for some specefic letters from the french alphabet as I work in the french speaking part of Switzerland.

Also as I need to switch between MacOS and Ubuntu I've created a way to switch from one to the other and still have the same shortcuts positioning (`ctrl` and `cmd` have been inverted).

You can download this and install it as is on your Kimiko or feel free to create a fork for your own needs.
